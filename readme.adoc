= Browser Pad

A simple HTML page that turns your browser into a basic editor.

== Usage

Use online at: https://mkaz.github.io/browser-pad/

or

. Clone repo

. Open the `index.html` file in your brower. No server needed.

. Type.

The page will auto save every minute to localStorage, so when you come back
whatever you type persists.

That's it.

== Why?

It makes for a simple & fast scratch pad. Bookmark, or even set as homepage,
then a quick place to type is just a click away.

Plus you get browser spellcheck, and if you use a browser plugin like Grammarly
or Microsoft Editor you get grammar suggestions too. This makes it better for
me then most markdown electron apps.
