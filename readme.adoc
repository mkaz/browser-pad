= Browser Pad

A simple HTML page that turns your browser into a basic editor.

== Usage

1. Open the `editor.html` file in your brower and bookmark.

2. Type.

The page will auto save every minute to localStorage, so when you come back
whatever you type persists.

That's it.

== Why?

It is a nice little scratch pad. If you bookmark in your brower, or set as homepage,
just a click away.

Plus you get browser spellcheck, and if you use a browser plugin like Grammarly
or Microsoft Editor you get grammar suggestions too. This makes it better then
most markdown electron apps.
